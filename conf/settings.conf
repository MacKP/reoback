# This is the configuration file for REOBack.  Note that the default
# configuration file is "settings.cfg".  However, you can create your own
# configuration file and pass it as a parameter to the backup program.

# Used only as an identifier for this backup. Normally the hostname.
host            = UNKNOWN

# This is the number of days you want to keep backups.  Note that the 
# actual number of archives kept is "backupdays" times 2.  That way, when 
# it comes time for auto deletion, you always have a history of 
# "backupdays" worth of information.
